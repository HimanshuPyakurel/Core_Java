	 * ================== OOP =============--------------------
	 *   
	 *   1> Class and object
	 *   2> Encapsulation
	 *   3> Inheritance
	 *   4> Polymorphism
	 *   5> Abstraction
	 *      a) Abstract class
	 *      b) Interface
	 *      
	 *    * Cohesive(gathering on one) must be high and 
	 *    * Coupling(dependency between package) must be low
	 *      
	 *   
	 *  ====================== Class & Object ===================
	 *      
	 *    # Class :-
	 *    -----------
	 *      -> use to represent real world entities...(like car, jacket, pen,etc)
	 *      -> class contain properties and methods.
	 *      -> its a collection/group of object having similar behaviors.
	 *      -> also called template/blue print of object.
	 *      -> its a user defined and reference data type.
	 *       
	 *      syntax:
	 *      
	 *        class class_name{
	 *        
	 *       	 //Properties
	 *        
	 *        	// Methods
	 *        
	 *        }
	 *        
	 *        
	 *    # Object/Instance :-
	 *    --------------------
	 *        -> implementation of class.
	 *        -> instance of class.
	 *        -> object contains instance variable and instance methods.
	 *        -> object allocates memory when it created
	 *        
	 *        syntax:
	 *        
	 *            class_name object_name = new class_name();
	 *                     
	 *
